      "\n",
      "Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and perception. AI systems use algorithms and data to make predictions, classify objects, and generate insights, often with greater speed and accuracy than humans. AI can be categorized into two main types: Narrow or Weak AI, which performs a specific task, and General or Strong AI, which has human-like intelligence and can perform any intellectual task. AI has numerous applications, including robotics, healthcare, finance, and transportation, and has the potential to revolutionize many industries.\n"
